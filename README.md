Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio!

I’m an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in security concepts. After completing the Google Cybersecurity Analyst Program, I gained hands-on knowledge in:

 •	Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Understanding its role in protecting organizations.

 •	Security Frameworks & Controls: Managing risks and safeguarding operations.

 •	Network Security: Securing networks against vulnerabilities.

 •	Linux & SQL: Using Linux commands and querying databases with SQL.

 •	Threat Modeling & Incident Response: Assessing threats and managing incidents.

 •	Python for Cybersecurity: Automating tasks with Python (currently incorporating scripts).

 •	I’m also currently learning Splunk to enhance my skills in security monitoring and data analysis. This portfolio reflects my progress and ongoing growth in the field.

In This Repository, You’ll Find:

 •	Overview of Google Cybersecurity Analyst Courses: Key takeaways from each course.

 •	Sample Python Scripts: Demonstrating basic security automation (coming soon!).

 •	Network Security Diagrams: Illustrating secure configurations (if applicable).

(As I gain experience, I plan to add):

 •	Real-World Projects: Practical examples of cybersecurity work (with permission).

 •	Resources & Communities: Links to helpful cybersecurity networks I engage with.

Stay tuned as I continue growing in this dynamic field!
